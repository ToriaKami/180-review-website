            <h2>Hey, I’m Scout.</h2>
            <p><strong>Long story short: I help good brands earn real trust through honest reviews by real people. No gimmicks. No paid fluff. Just human-to-human storytelling, amplified by smart strategy.</strong></p>
            <p>I kind of fell into this line of work by accident.</p>
            <p>Back in college, I was freelancing for a tiny indie skincare brand. They couldn’t afford ads, so I started cold-emailing bloggers to see if they’d try the products and write about them.</p>
            <p>A few actually did—and their posts moved more product in a week than the brand had sold in months. I’ve been chasing that kind of magic ever since.</p>
            <p>These days, I work with e-commerce businesses—especially the scrappy, underdog ones—to get their products into the hands of the right reviewers. I spend way too much time in Ahrefs, stalking competitor backlinks like it’s a full-time sport, and I’m slightly obsessive about vetting bloggers (my “no fluff zone” is a real thing).</p>
            <p>If your product’s good and your story’s real, I’ll help make sure the right people talk about it.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Outside of work, I’m trying to get better at making dumplings from scratch (so far, they all look like mini pillows of regret).</p>
            <p>My partner, Ella, is a birdwatcher who swears she once saw a rare black-collared hawk in our backyard—I remain skeptical. We live with a 14-pound cat named Raisin, who only ever knocks things off the counter when I’m on Zoom calls. Classic.</p>
            <p>This whole journey? Still a work in progress. But I'm loving every single part of it.</p>
